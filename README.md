# Uwall

Ultra Wall by Nemesea - Add-on for Ben987's BondageClub game

**Note: If you use the FBC mod, don't use this stand-alone version of Uwall, but enable/disable Uwall in FBC settings.**

A very simple mod to protect you from trolls abusing ULTRAbc commands with target.

Can be used without need to have also ULTRAbc.

It's a toggle command /uwall to enable or disable the protection.

By default, the protection is enabled (since version 1.1)

When enabled, ULTRAbc will detect it when some commands are targetting you. 
The commands will not be executed and the command user will be informed about that.
No any change or message will be sent to the target screen.

Thanks to Sidsel for permission to use some BCE/FBC code!

# How to disable the Uwall protection?

**If you are an UBC user and want to fully enjoy all the UBC features, you need to disable Uwall, at least when you play with friends.**

**If you use the FBC mod, you need to unselect the case in page 2 of Immersion Settings**

**If you don't use FBC, but only the Uwall mod, you need to use the toggle /uwall command**
